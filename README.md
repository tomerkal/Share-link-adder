# Share-link-adder
A userscript which adds the Share button to the "Other answers" in review queues.

Was originally intended for queues like Low quality answers, Late answers and First answers (where it might be relevant to reference other existing answers to the answer you're reviewing), but as a side effect it actually works on all queues (even close votes, triage etc. have an Answers tab when such exist).
